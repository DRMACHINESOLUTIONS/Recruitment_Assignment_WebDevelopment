# Recruitment_Assignment_WebDevelopment

Assignment:-

As a part of the screening process, we conducted an open assignment with timeframe of 10 days for the completion of the task from their respective assignment start dates. We have attached the source codes of all the applicants those who have completed with the assignment to the community, as we always believe in knowledge sharing & learning process. So, you can find the codes as zip files. 

Create a table named USERS with the following fields (id, username, password, confirm-password, email, address). Then, create a user-login webpage with the fields (Username & Password) and a SignIn button. On the same user-login page provide the Hyperlink fields for Register & Forgot Password below SignIn button. 

After, sign-in display a page with a Welcome message for that username. Now, create a simple andriod app for login similar to the webpage. **Note** the app has to be integrated with the webpage (which means the user should be able to login to both the app and website with the same login credentials)

Note:- You can use any languages of your choice. 
**Java, .NET, PHP, HTML, SQL, XML, Android, MySQL, CSS, JavaScript, SQLITE, Django, Flask**


** ALWAYS KEEP LEARNING **
